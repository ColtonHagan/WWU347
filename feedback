Would have liked to see a bit more plan about the approach/algorithm to implement the functions.

Compiler warnings:

find.c:106:15: warning: comparison between pointer and zero character constant [-Wpointer-compare]
     if(substr == '\0') {
               ^~
find.c:106:8: note: did you mean to dereference the pointer?
     if(substr == '\0') {
        ^

Good job!  You're mixing tabs and spaces though.
