Start
Estimated Time	5HH 0MM
Plan:
My current plan is to :
1) get the argparse file working since I have a really good idea how to do so
2) read in and print user input from the command line 
4) builtin functions
5) proccessline function
6) write my own mkdir function
7) add error checks and messages
8) double check everything is working
I will do incremental testing and error checking/handling throughout these steps

Complete
Actual Time	3HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Overall I had a few issues, but most of them stemmed from my lack of general familiarity with c rather than specific concepts that we were working on. Although, I did have some small issues with malloc and when and where I should use it (which I improved on throughout the project) and struggled a bit on realizing I needed to put an exit in the child from fork. Overall I think I improved my C understanding, ability to work with a fork, and using makefile.
