Start
Estimated Time	0HH 30MM
Plan: I plan to
1) Get the details of the file with stats and st_mode 
2) Check if the file is regular
3) Format/Finish checking file type
4) Get and check the time 
5) Figure out how to formate the time using time.h 
6) Finish and formate the last accessed time
7) Check if the file is readable by user
8) Formate for all user permissions
9) Finish by replicating step 8 for group and other
10) Double check everything
With testing and bug-fixing between each step

Complete
Actual Time	0HH 45MM
Observations: Most everything went smoothly, the biggest struggle was formatting the time, as it took me a few minutes to figure out how to use time.h properly, but outside of that I did not have much trouble. Overall I just learned more about using stat and how to use time.h (at least in some ways).
